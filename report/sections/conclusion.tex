\section{Conclusion}
It's time to wrap things up. I must say this seemingly small-scaled project gave me much more of what I expected. It may hard to catch up at first but when the pace is maintained, one could push it far beyond expectation. After all, I would like to give my professor, Mr. Nhan, a big thankful appreciation, for his wonderful dedication to the teaching of this course.
